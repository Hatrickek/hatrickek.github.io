Having a personal website is a great way to stay motivated and productive. By regularly updating my website with new blog posts,
I am able to share my process and techniques with others, which in turn inspires me to work harder and finish projects that I have started.

Additionally, writing about my work helps me to be more creative and generate new ideas. By documenting my progress and explaining how I implemented certain features, 
I'm able to deepen my understanding of that subject matter since writing about it requires more knowledge than just implementing it. And my website could serve as a platform to advertise my future projects, allowing me to share my ideas with a wider audience and reach new heights in my journey.
