It looked simple and is enough to showcase almost all features\\nof the engine.\\nIn this blog post I will show the steps I have taken while making the game so it\'s going to be something like a tutorial you would read for known engines like Unity, Unreal etc.\\n\\nSo let us begin...\\n\\n# Project\\nNow first thing you will see when you launch the engine is going to be a project selection panel. First row is showing us the recent projects \\nI have opened and below that buttons to load or create projects with a file dialog.\\n![Project Selector](projects.png)\\n\\nProjects in Oxylus is just a yaml file specifying the name, start scene path, and asset directory:\\n\\n```yml \\nProject:\\n  Name: ProjectCyclone\\n  StartScene: \\"Scenes/Main.oxscene\\"\\n  AssetDirectory: \\"Assets\\"\\n```\\n\\n# Scene \\nNow we need assets to load for our scene. I have found a nice [helicopter model](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/low-poly-helicopter-5bbed2de9baa4a13a7faa72653b78b64) \\nfrom sketchfab. You can just download, drag and drop it to the editor. Oxylus will load every mesh and materials then create parented entities according to gltf node.\\n![Scene](scene.png)\\n\\nAnd for now I will use a plane to have a ground. For the ground I will create a material and just make it have a green color. Then drag and drop it to the plane.\\n![Material](Material.gif)\\n\\n# Systems\\nWhen we edit scenes seeing the result directly on runtime is very useful. So for this reason I have created a `HotReloadableScene` system using Oxylus Core Systems and Oxylus Event System.\\n\\nSystems can be added to the engine while creating the application:\\n\\n```cpp\\nconst auto app = new ProjectCyclone(spec);\\napp->PushLayer(new ::ProjectCyclone::GameLayer())\\n    .AddSystem<HotReloadableScenes>(\\"Assets/Scenes/Main.oxscene\\");\\n```\\n\\nThen system event is handled on the `GameLayer` with `OnEvent` callback:\\n```cpp\\nbool GameLayer::OnSceneReload(ReloadSceneEvent&) {\\n  LoadScene();\\n  OX_CORE_INFO(\\"Scene reloaded.\\");\\n  return true;\\n}\\n\\nvoid GameLayer::OnEvent(Event& e) {\\n  EventDispatcher dispatcher(e);\\n  dispatcher.Dispatch<ReloadSceneEvent>(OX_BIND_EVENT_FN(GameLayer::OnSceneReload));\\n}\\n```\\n\\n`HotReloadableScene` is just a simple system that is checking the provided scene path to see if any change happened. \\n```cpp\\nif (last_write_time(m_ScenePath).time_since_epoch().count() != \\n    m_LastWriteTime.time_since_epoch().count()) {\\n  m_LastWriteTime = last_write_time(m_ScenePath);\\n  ReloadSceneEvent event;\\n  m_EventCallback(event);\\n}\\n```\\n![HotReloadableScenes](HotReloadableScene.gif)\\n\\n# Gameplay\\n\\nNow we can start working on the gameplay part and prove otherwise the famous phrase about engine devs \ud83d\ude1b:    \\n> Give someone an engine and they\'ll make a game. Teach someone to make an engine and they\'ll never make anything.\\n\\nI will start with creating a simple helicopter system to move the helicopter. And make the propellers turn around itself.   \\n\\nWe can either use the `ScriptableEntity` way or use \\"raw\\" ecs. I have picked the raw ecs way since we don\'t need any callbacks \\nfrom the `ScriptableEntity` api.    \\n```cpp\\nstruct HeliComponent {\\n  float Speed = 5.0f; \\n  float Fuel = 1.0f;  //1.0f = Full, 0.0f = Empty\\n  float Altitude = 0.0f;\\n};\\n```\\n\\n```cpp\\nvoid HeliSystem::OnUpdate(HeliComponent& component, const float deltaTime, TransformComponent& transform) {\\n  //Move horizontal\\n  if (Input::GetKeyDown(Key::W)) {\\n    transform.Translation.z += component.Speed * deltaTime;\\n  }\\n  //...\\n  //Other keys\\n  //...\\n\\n  //Move vertical\\n  if (Input::GetKeyDown(Key::Q) && component.Altitude >= 0.15f) {\\n    transform.Translation.y -= component.Speed * deltaTime;\\n  }\\n  else if (Input::GetKeyDown(Key::E) && component.Altitude < 8.0f) {\\n    transform.Translation.y += component.Speed * deltaTime;\\n  }\\n\\n  //For now just lower the fuel constantly\\n  component.Fuel -= 0.1f * ImGui::GetIO().DeltaTime;\\n  component.Altitude = transform.Translation.y;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThen we iterate over entites.\\n\\n```cpp\\nconst auto group = m_Scene->m_Registry.view<TransformComponent, HeliComponent>();\\n  for (const auto entity : group) {\\n    auto&& [transform, heli] = group.get<TransformComponent, HeliComponent>(entity);\\n    HeliSystem::OnUpdate(heli, deltaTime, transform);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFor rotating the propeller just getting the transform component and adding a constant value to y rotation would work for now. \\n\\n```cpp\\nauto ent = Oxylus::Entity { entity, m_Scene.get() };\\nent.GetChild(1).GetComponent<Oxylus::TransformComponent>().Rotation.y += 5.0f;\\n```\\n\\n# UI \\nFor creating a game UI we can use `OxUI` api which uses Dear ImGui underneath for drawing and layouts.\\nCyclone has a HUD that contains instrumentation which includes speed, altitude, fuel remaining and time remaining.\\nAdditionally there is also information on the number of supply crates, whether the player\'s current view is North \\nor South, information on wind force and a warning to the player of the cyclone\'s proximity and any approaching planes.     \\nFor now I will just display altitude, remaining fuel and time.\\n```cpp\\nOxUI::BeginUI();\\nOxUI::ProgressBar(\\"Time\\", Time);\\nOxUI::ProgressBar(\\"Fuel\\", Heli->Fuel);\\nOxUI::Property(\\"Altitude\\", \\"%.1f\\", Heli->Altitude);\\nOxUI::EndUI();\\n```\\n![UI](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1022588581237248060/1087718914886221904/image.png)"},{"id":"oxylus-engine-intro","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/oxylus-engine-intro","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/oxylus-engine-intro/2023-01-15-oxylus-engine-intro.md","source":"@site/blog/oxylus-engine-intro/2023-01-15-oxylus-engine-intro.md","title":"Oxylus Engine - Introduction","description":"My own engine I have been working on since 2022-06 in my free time.
